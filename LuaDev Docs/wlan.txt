boolean wlan.init (config)
  Connect to a wireless access point.
  parameters:
  config connection number to use. If you specify a number, use the connection previously configured on the PSP. When using the connection number 0, connections dialog opens and the user choose the preferred connection.
  Unless you use the dialog, this function returns immediately, thus attempting to connect immediately after using this function would give error, because it takes a few seconds to connect. You can check the status of the connection using the function xxxxxxx.

  True if connected or started connecting, otherwise false.
